## Introduction
RX1 Humanoid is an opensource robot project hosted on [http://www.redrabbitrobotics.cc](http://www.redrabbitrobotics.cc). This repo is a ROS1 meta package containing basic functioning packages of the RX1 humanoid including the following:  

* rx1_description: URDF file  
* rx1_motor: Feetech servo motor control
* rx1_ik: Inverse Kinematics demo
* rx1_bringup: Launch everything
* rx1_gazebo: Gazebo simulation

## Installation
Assuming you have already had ROS 1 Noetic or Melodic installed in your Ubuntu computer.

Dependencies:

* [feetech_lib](https://github.com/Red-Rabbit-Robotics/feetech_lib)
* [ik\_solver\_lib](https://github.com/Red-Rabbit-Robotics/ik_solver_lib)
* other packages listed in the package.xml files you can install through:  
`rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y`

## Demo
1. Test the URDF  
`roslaunch rx1_description urdf_test.launch`  
You should be able control the joint angles through sliders.

2. Test the inverse kinematics  
`roslaunch rx1_description urdf.launch`  
`roslaunch rx1_ik rx1_ik_marker.launch`  
You should be able click and drag the end effector poses to play with the ik.

3. Test with the actual robots  
Go to rx1_motor.launch file and modify the USB port value to the corresponding one of your Feetech servo controller board.  
Then, after doing either 1 or 2 above, type:  
`roslaunch rx1_motor rx1_motor.launch`   
You should be able to see the actual robot move based on your commands.

4. Gazebo simulation  
Install dependencies:  
`pip install tk`  
Run simulation:  
`roslaunch rx1_gazebo rx1_gazebo.launch`  
`roscd rx1_gazebo/scripts/`  
`python3 controller_gui_example.py`  
You should be able click and drag the sliders and command joints angles through the GUI.

## Extra notes

1. Note that some of the mesh files don't match exactly the latest CAD file of the RX1 Humanoid robot due to development overtime. The overall shape stays the same though.
2. The inertia values in the `rx1.urdf.xacro` file are placeholders, while the `rx1.urdf` has the proper inertia values and it's created by using the `rx1_description/scripts/calc_inertia.py` script. (**acknowledgement**: this script is modified from [https://github.com/gstavrinos/calc-inertia/blob/master/calc_inertia_for_urdf.py](https://github.com/gstavrinos/calc-inertia/blob/master/calc_inertia_for_urdf.py))
3. To launch everything by `roslaunch rx1_bringup bringup.launch` , you need to have the depth camera's ROS package [OrbbecSDK_ROS1](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_ROS1) installed as well.
